Add proximity beep sound files here for audio warnings:
- beep-low.mp3  (far threat)
- beep-mid.mp3  (close threat)
- beep-high.mp3 (danger)

You can use short sine or square wave tones (e.g. generate with Audacity).
If these files are missing, the overlay will still work but proximity audio will not play.
